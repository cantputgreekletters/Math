# Math <a name="Math"></a>
 Various Math functions and classes that one might want to use. This "Library" is made mostly for fun other than to be actually used.

External libraries used: matplotlib.pyplot

If you wish to use it for your personal code or to modify it be free to do it.



# Classes <a name="Classes"></a>
## Vector2 <a name="Vector2"></a>
By using two numbers int or float you make a vector (They are 2D).

Vector2(x,y)

x,y need to be numbers

You can add,subtract, iterate a Vector2 object and use them in the Draw Class

## Line  <a name="Lines"></a>
By using two Vectors you can make a line

line(finish,start = Vector2(0,0))

start,finish need to be Vector2 Objects

You can use a line in the Draw Class

## Draw(fig = plt.figure()) <a name="Draw"></a>
self.Plot = plt

self.fig = fig

self.ax = self.fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)

This class has various methods that are used to draw shapes using matplotlib.

### Draw.Line(*lines) <a name="Draw.Line"></a>
You can pass an infinite ammount of line objects and they are drawn in matplotlib.

### Draw.Triangle(*vectors,offset = Vector2(0,0)) <a name="Draw.Triangle"></a>
You can pass three Vector2 objects and make a triangle with this method and set an offset to the triangle

### Draw.Square(size,offset = Vector2(0,0)) <a name="Draw.Square"></a>
You can pass a number and a square is drawn with the size that you passed and set an offset to the squarea.

### Draw.Point(*points) <a name="Draw.Point"></a>
You can pass an infinite amount of objects of the class Vector2 and visualize them in matplotlib.


# Functions <a name="Functions"></a>
### Sum(i,n,func) <a name="Sum"></a>
It works just like the Î£ in maths.

i,n need to be int

'func' example: def F(x): return x^2

### Factorial(n) <a name="Factorial"></a>

Returns the factorial of given number.

### Choose(n,k) <a name="Choose"></a>

Returns the binomial coefficient of n and k.

### BinomialProbability(n,x,p) <a name="BinomialProbability"></a>

Returns the Binomial Probability of n, x and p where:

The number of trials, denoted by 'n'.

The probability of success on each trial, denoted by 'p'.

The desired number of successes, denoted by 'x'.

### Standard_Deviation(x) <a name="Standard_Deviation"></a>

Returns the standard deviation of a data set.

### PDF(x,m,std) <a name="PDF"></a>

Probability distribution function.

### LinSpace(a,b,points) <a name="LinSpace"></a>

Takes a range "a","b" and returns a tuple of all the values between said range that are split to the nuber of "points"

### MinMax(a,b,points) <a name="MinMax"></a>

Returns the minimum and maximum value of a list. 

### Mean(x) <a name="Mean"></a>

Returns the average of a list.

### Median(x) <a name="Median"></a>

Returns the middle value of a list.

### Mode(x) <a name="Mode"></a>

Returns the most common value of a list.
